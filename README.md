## Project Overview

Café Harmony is a fast-growing virtual café chain specializing in drinks, snacks, and light meals. With multiple locations across the city, the café is experiencing rapid growth but also facing challenges around sales optimization, stock management, and customer satisfaction.
This project analyses two year of Café Harmony’s business data—sales, customers, inventory, employees, and feedback—to uncover insights that improve operational efficiency and customer experience.
An interactive Excel dashboard summarizes key metrics and trends for management decision-making.

## Project Scope

The project covers five key operational areas of Café Harmony:

- Sales trends across time and locations.

-	Menu performance by product category.

- Customer demographics and spending patterns.

-	Stock and inventory management.

-	Employee and location performance.

-	Customer feedback sentiment analysis.

## Project Objectives

-	Clean and prepare all datasets for analysis.
  
-	Analyse sales, customer, stock, employee, and feedback data.
  
-	Develop an interactive Excel dashboard with slicers, pivot tables, and charts.
  
-	Provide insights and recommendations for management decision-making.

## Data Sources

The project used multiple datasets provided in Excel format:

-	Sales Data: Transactions including items, prices, quantities, and dates.
  
-	Customer Data: Age, gender, location, preferred items.
  
-	Employee Data: Roles, salaries, and location assignments.
-	Stock Data: Inventory of raw materials and supplies.
-	Feedback Data: Customer satisfaction ratings and comments.

## Tools

### Microsoft Excel:
-	Data cleaning with Power Query
  
-	Functions (SUMIF, COUNTIF, VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH)
  
-	PivotTables & Pivot Charts
  
-	Interactive Dashboard with slicers

## Data Cleaning/ Preparation

- Removed duplicates and corrected missing/blank values.
  
- Standardized date formats across datasets.
  
- Merged multiple datasets for cross-analysis.
  
- Created calculated columns (e.g., profit margin, monthly sales).

## Data Analysis

The project answered the following business questions:

1.	Sales Trends: How is the overall sales trend performing?

2.	Menu Performance: Which menu items generate the most revenue?

3.	Customer Spending: Which demographic (age, gender, preferences) drives the highest sales?

4.	Stock Management: Which ingredients or products run out most often?

5.	Employee Performance: Which employees or locations perform above/below average?

6.  Customer Feedback: What common themes exist in satisfaction/dissatisfaction?

## Results/Findings

**Sales Trend:** Sales show a positive trend but fluctuate seasonally with a spike in Q4.

**Menu Performance:** Muffins and Iced-Tea sandwiches generated the highest revenue 

**Customer Insights:** 28–37 age group spends the most; females slightly outspend males.

**Stock Management:** Certain high-demand ingredients (e.g., Iced-Tea bags, milk) often run low.

**Employee/Location:** Some employees consistently outperform in sales relative to location averages.

**Feedback:** Customer feedback highlights praise for product quality but notes delays in service.

## **Recommendations**

-	Focus marketing campaigns on the 28–37 age group, especially for new product launches.

-	Improve inventory forecasting for high-demand items to reduce stock-outs.

-	Introduce performance incentives for employees based on sales contributions.

-	Enhance operational efficiency at slower locations with targeted training.

- Address customer service issues by reducing wait times.

- Continue to monitor feedback with monthly sentiment analysis.

## Conclusion

This Excel project demonstrates how multiple datasets can be cleaned, integrated, and analysed to generate insights that directly support decision-making. The interactive dashboard provides a clear, visual way for Café Harmony’s management to track KPIs and respond quickly to business challenges.

## Limitations

- Analysis is based only on available datasets; external market conditions are not considered.
  
- Feedback data is limited to customers who responded, which may not reflect all customer opinions.
  
- No external market or competitor data included.
